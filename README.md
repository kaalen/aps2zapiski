This is an absolutely ancient repository with LaTex notes from a undergraduate computer science course Algorithms and Data Structures at Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Ljubljana.
The notes were taken during lectures and seminars and were contributed by multiple students.

The notes are in Slovenian language (not English, sorry).
